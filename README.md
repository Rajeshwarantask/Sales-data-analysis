![sales_trend](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a28ba6b5-cb51-4961-897b-89f5e3c65133)

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage big data technologies to analyze historical sales and customer behavior data, identify trends in product demand, and optimize promotional strategies. The key goal is to increase profits by focusing on products with high demand, reducing inventory for low-selling products, and fine-tuning promotions based on data-driven insights.

## Objective

- Predict sales and identify high-demand products.
- Optimize promotions to maximize profit.
- Analyze large-scale customer and transactional data using Apache Spark.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Apache Spark**: For processing and analyzing large datasets.
- **Python (PySpark)**: For data manipulation and building machine learning models.
- **Hadoop HDFS / Amazon S3**: To store and manage large datasets.
- **MLlib**: Sparkâ€™s Machine Learning Library for predictive modeling.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly**: For visualizing data and presenting insights.
- **Jupyter Notebooks / Databricks**: For collaborative development.

## Data Sources

- **Customer Data**: Demographics, loyalty programs, churn status.
- **Transactional Data**: Sales transactions, product details, discount information, payment methods.
- **Product Information**: Product reviews, ratings, return rates, stock availability.
- **Promotional Data**: Promotion types, effectiveness, and customer targeting.
- **Geographical Data**: Store locations, customer proximity to stores.
- **Seasonal and Temporal Data**: Time of year, holiday season impact on sales.

## Key Objectives

1. **Sales Forecasting**
   - Predict future sales trends and identify peak sales periods.
   - Forecast sales for individual products and categories.

2. **Product Demand Analysis**
   - Determine high-demand and high-profit products.
   - Identify underperforming products for inventory reduction.

3. **Promotion Optimization**
   - Assess effective promotion strategies using customer behavior data.
   - Tailor promotions to maximize sales on average-selling products.

4. **Churn Prediction and Customer Segmentation**
   - Predict customer churn and segment customers for targeted marketing.
   - Analyze customer lifetime value (CLV) for prioritizing promotions.

## Steps to Implement

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load large-scale data into Apache Spark and clean it.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize key metrics and identify trends and outliers.

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Train time-series models for sales prediction.
   - Implement classification models for product demand and churn prediction.

4. **Promotion Effectiveness Analysis**
   - Measure the effectiveness of promotions using customer segmentation.

5. **Optimization and Deployment**
   - Optimize stock levels and implement dynamic pricing strategies.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**
   - Generate visual reports and create interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring.

## Expected Outcomes

- Increased Profitability: Focus on high-demand products and optimized promotions.
- Reduced Stock Waste: Identify low-demand products and adjust inventory.
- Enhanced Customer Retention: Personalize promotions and reduce churn.
- Data-Driven Decision Making: Actionable insights to inform strategies.

## Next Steps

- Set up a Spark cluster for data processing.
- Ingest CSV files into Spark DataFrames and begin preprocessing.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis and build predictive models.
